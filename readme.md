# My dotfiles

Uploading these here so I can have the same interface I am confortable with on any machine I want.
The vimrc is copied from https://github.com/amix/vimrc and then changed as I felt the need.

To use my vimrc file, enter `wget -P ~/ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nakulpathak3/dotfiles/master/.vimrc` in your terminal. 

This assumes you don't have an existing .vimrc. If you do (quite likely; `vim ~/.vimrc` to check), you might want to move that to a different location as a backup and then execute that wget command.
